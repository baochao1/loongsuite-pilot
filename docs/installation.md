# Installation

English | [简体中文](zh-CN/installation.md)

Use this guide to install, verify, uninstall, or run LoongSuite Pilot from source.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- `npm`
- `curl` or `wget`
- PowerShell 5.1 or later on Windows

## Install From Public Package On Linux Or macOS

```bash
curl -fsSL https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.sh -o /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh && bash /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh install
```

The installer detects supported agents, lets you choose which agents to monitor, deploys hooks/plugins, writes the local configuration, and starts the background service.

## Install From Public Package On Windows

Run PowerShell and install from the published Windows package:

```powershell
$installer = "$env:TEMP\loongsuite-pilot-installer.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.ps1" `
  -OutFile $installer
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer install
```

The Windows installer downloads `loongsuite-pilot.zip` by default. It stores data under `%USERPROFILE%\.loongsuite-pilot` and installs the `loongsuite-pilot` command under `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`. Open a new PowerShell window if the command is not found immediately after installation.

## Offline Install On Windows (Offline Bundle)

For machines **without network access**, build a self-contained offline bundle that includes the compiled app, all dependencies (`node_modules` with win32-x64 native binaries) and a Node.js runtime — the target machine needs no Node installed and never touches the network.

### Build the offline bundle (on a networked Windows machine)

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy\package-offline-win.ps1
```

Output (under `out\offline\`):

- `loongsuite-pilot-offline-win-x64\` — extracted bundle
- `loongsuite-pilot-offline-win-x64-v<version>.zip` — single-file deliverable

Script options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-NodeVersion <ver>` | Node.js runtime version to bundle (default `22.22.2`). |
| `-NodeUrl <url>` | Override the Node.js zip download URL. |
| `-UseSystemNode` | Bundle the locally installed Node instead of downloading one. |
| `-SkipBuild` | Skip `npm run build` (existing `dist/` is reused). |
| `-SkipDeps` | Skip `npm ci` (existing `node_modules/` is reused). |
| `-SkipZip` | Keep only the extracted bundle directory. |
| `-OutDir <path>` | Output directory (default `<repo>\out\offline`). |

### Install offline on the target machine

Copy the bundle (or the unzipped zip) to the target machine, then:

```powershell
.\install-offline.ps1
```

Configure SLS output by appending the same options as a regular install, for example:

```powershell
.\install-offline.ps1 -SlsEndpoint "https://cn-hangzhou.log.aliyuncs.com" -SlsProject "my-project" -SlsLogstore "my-logstore" -SlsAkId "LTAI..." -SlsAkSecret "...."
```

Uninstall (from the bundle directory):

```powershell
.\uninstall-offline.ps1            # keep config & data
.\uninstall-offline.ps1 -Purge     # remove config & data too
```

Notes:

- The bundled Node.js runtime is copied into the data directory during install, so the bundle can be deleted afterwards.
- The bundle must be kept intact (`package/`, `node/` and `installer-opensource.ps1` are all required).
- Upgrading is just running a newer `install-offline.ps1` in place — config/data are preserved and rollback is automatic.

## Install With Common Options

Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.sh -o /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh && bash /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh install \
  --agents "claude-code,cursor,codex" \
  --userId "your-user-id" \
  --sls-endpoint "https://cn-hangzhou.log.aliyuncs.com" \
  --sls-project "my-project" \
  --sls-logstore "my-logstore" \
  --mask-mode all
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = "$env:TEMP\loongsuite-pilot-installer.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.ps1" `
  -OutFile $installer
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer install `
  -Agents "claude-code,cursor,codex" `
  -UserId "your-user-id" `
  -SlsEndpoint "https://cn-hangzhou.log.aliyuncs.com" `
  -SlsProject "my-project" `
  -SlsLogstore "my-logstore" `
  -MaskMode all
```

Installer options:

The Linux/macOS installer uses `--kebab-case` options. The Windows PowerShell installer uses the corresponding `-PascalCase` options, for example `--version` becomes `-Version` and `--data-dir` becomes `-DataDir`.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `--version <ver>` | Install a specific version, for example `1.2.0`. |
| `--agents <list>` | Comma-separated agent list. Skips interactive selection. |
| `--userId <id>` | Set user identity written to output events. |
| `--data-dir <path>` | Override data directory. Default is `~/.loongsuite-pilot`. |
| `--dashboard-port <port>` | Optional Dashboard port, an integer from `1` to `65535`. Defaults to `8765` on first install; preserves the existing port on reinstall when omitted. Windows: `-DashboardPort <port>`. |
| `--package-url <url>` | Install from a custom URL or local `file://` path. |
| `--sls-endpoint <url>` | SLS endpoint URL. |
| `--sls-project <name>` | SLS project name. |
| `--sls-logstore <name>` | SLS logstore name. |
| `--sls-ak-id <key>` | SLS Access Key ID for AK mode. |
| `--sls-ak-secret <key>` | SLS Access Key Secret for AK mode. |
| `--sls-api-key <key>` | SLS API Key for API Key mode. Cannot be combined with AK/SK flags. |
| `--mask-mode <mode>` | Data masking mode: `all`, `none`, or `custom`. |
| `--mask-types <list>` | Comma-separated mask types. Required when `--mask-mode custom`. |
| `--collect-log <true\|false>` | Enable or disable SLS log reporting. |
| `--collect-trace <true\|false>` | Enable or disable trace reporting. |
| `--cms-license-key <key>` | CMS or ARMS trace license key. |
| `--cms-endpoint <url>` | CMS or ARMS trace endpoint. |
| `--cms-workspace <name>` | CMS workspace value. |
| `--service-name-prefix <name>` | Service name prefix used by reporting backends. |
| `--system-service` | **Deprecated** — ignored. Init system is now auto-detected (systemd-user → systemd-system → init.d). |
| `--lang <lang>` | Output language: `zh` or `en`. |

For example, use port `9000` by appending `--dashboard-port 9000` (or `--dashboard-port=9000`) to the Linux/macOS install command, or `-DashboardPort 9000` to the Windows command. The installer writes `dashboard.port` to `config.json` before starting the service. Open `http://127.0.0.1:9000/` after installation. Invalid or missing port values stop installation before downloads or service changes.

## Verify Installation

```bash
loongsuite-pilot status
loongsuite-pilot info
```

Local JSONL output is enabled by default:

```bash
ls ~/.loongsuite-pilot/logs/output
```

On Windows:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\.loongsuite-pilot\logs\output"
```

## Service Management

```bash
loongsuite-pilot start
loongsuite-pilot stop
loongsuite-pilot restart
loongsuite-pilot status
loongsuite-pilot info
loongsuite-pilot token-usage
loongsuite-pilot rollback
```

The local dashboard starts and stops with the collector. Open the default address below, or use your configured port:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

The page reads `logs/metrics-summary.json` directly and does not run a second
aggregation pipeline.

### Start or stop the macOS menu bar app

The menu bar app starts with the collector by default. Quitting it leaves collection running, so another `loongsuite-pilot start` does not reopen it. Use:

```bash
loongsuite-pilot menubar start
```

This persists `"enableStatusBarApp": true` in the active `config.json`, starts only the menu bar app, and reuses an existing instance. Run it in your macOS desktop terminal without `sudo`. The collector must already be running; otherwise run `loongsuite-pilot start`, wait for startup, and retry. If `LOONGSUITE_PILOT_ENABLE_STATUS_BAR_APP` disables the app, unset it or set it to `true` first. Startup logs are in `logs/app-status-bar/` under your data directory.

To close only the menu bar app:

```bash
loongsuite-pilot menubar stop
```

Collection keeps running. This also works when the collector is stopped or the menu bar app is disabled, and succeeds if the app is already stopped. It persists `"enableStatusBarApp": false`, so the next collector startup leaves the app closed.

`LOONGSUITE_PILOT_ENABLE_STATUS_BAR_APP` keeps higher priority than the file. An environment value that enables the app can override the persisted `false` on future Pilot starts; the command prints a warning when it detects this conflict.

After a source build, `node dist/index.js menubar start` and `node dist/index.js menubar stop` provide the same commands without installing a new launcher.

### macOS Dashboard shortcut

Shortcut installation is **opt-in**. Normal Pilot installation, upgrades and
service starts do not create shortcuts or modify the Dock. This is separate
from the menu bar app.

```bash
loongsuite-pilot dashboard shortcut install
loongsuite-pilot dashboard shortcut status
loongsuite-pilot dashboard shortcut uninstall
```

`install` creates a radar-icon web shortcut at
`~/Library/Application Support/LoongSuite Pilot/Shortcuts/LoongSuite Pilot Dashboard.webloc`
and adds it to the Dock's files area (beside Downloads/Trash, not the applications
area). Clicking it uses the default browser. No `.app` is compiled or signed;
there is no additional software dependency, background process, or service restart.
The command uses Pilot's existing Node runtime and macOS system tools.

The URL is read from `dashboard.port` in the active configuration at **shortcut
installation time**. The CLI honors `AGENT_DATA_COLLECTION_CONFIG` and the installed
custom data directory; missing/invalid ports use the collector's default of
`8765`. For example, port `9000` produces `http://127.0.0.1:9000/`.
A `.webloc` stores a URL, not executable code: after changing the port, restart
Pilot as usual and rerun `dashboard shortcut install` to update the shortcut.
Repeated installation keeps the existing Dock position and does not add duplicates.
Upgrades/startup never silently re-add a shortcut you removed.

`status` is a read-only terminal report of the shortcut file path, **stored target
URL**, and Dock presence. It is not a service-health check. `uninstall` removes only
the matching managed Dock entry and moves the matching shortcut file to Trash;
it does not uninstall Pilot. Run it before uninstalling Pilot itself, or remove
the shortcut manually afterwards. Copies/moved files are not managed.

Only shortcuts marked as Pilot-managed for the same configuration are replaced
or removed. Unrelated files, symbolic links, other configurations, and locked or
managed Dock layouts are preserved. If the file is already missing, an orphaned
Dock item is reported for manual removal. Dock changes are backed up in the
shortcut directory's `Backups` subdirectory; uninstall keeps these backups.
The Dock preference format is not a public Apple API: layout changes are checked
before/after writing, and unsupported layouts fail rather than being overwritten.
The Dock briefly refreshes when an entry or icon changes.

The web shortcut only stores a URL. It does not check whether Pilot is running
or whether another program has taken its port. Use `loongsuite-pilot status` to
check Pilot's status if the browser cannot open the expected page.

## Uninstall

Uninstall stops the service, removes installed files, and cleans the integrations written into agent configs (hook entries for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Qoder, Qwen, etc., and the injected plugin spec in OpenCode's config). Add `--purge` (`-Purge` on Windows) to also delete the local data directory.

Keep data on Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.sh -o /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh && bash /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh uninstall
```

Remove installed files and local data on Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.sh -o /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh && bash /tmp/loongsuite-pilot-installer.sh uninstall --purge
```

Keep data on Windows:

```powershell
$installer = "$env:TEMP\loongsuite-pilot-installer.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.ps1" `
  -OutFile $installer
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer uninstall
```

Remove installed files and local data on Windows:

```powershell
$installer = "$env:TEMP\loongsuite-pilot-installer.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://loongcollector-community-edition.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/loongsuite-pilot/installer.ps1" `
  -OutFile $installer
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer uninstall -Purge
```

## Build And Run From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/loongsuite-pilot.git
cd loongsuite-pilot
npm install
npm run build
node scripts/postinstall.js
node dist/index.js
```

This starts the collector in the foreground. On startup, Pilot reads agent definitions from `agents.d/`, auto-detects installed agents, and deploys collection capabilities for detected agents.

## Install A Local Build As A Service

```bash
bash deploy/package-opensource.sh
bash deploy/installer-opensource.sh --package-url "file://$(pwd)/loongsuite-pilot.tar.gz"
```
