// Uninstall must not be abortable by something that has nothing to do with uninstalling.
//
// A measured Windows box left `%USERPROFILE%\.loongsuite-pilot\config.json` -- SLS
// AccessKeySecret and CMS license key inside it -- on disk after `-Uninstall -Purge`
// reported nothing wrong to look at. The chain:
//
//   1. Resolve-Node probes third-party version managers, and NVM_HOME is commonly a
//      *machine*-level variable pointing into another account's profile. A bare
//      Test-Path on an unreadable directory emits a PermissionDenied
//      UnauthorizedAccessException record, which $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop" -- set
//      in the header of every one of these scripts -- promotes to terminating.
//   2. Cmd-Uninstall called Resolve-Node bare, before any cleanup step. One terminating
//      error there skipped the plugin cleanups, the install-directory removal, and the
//      `if ($Purge)` branch that deletes the data dir. Nothing downstream repairs that:
//      the next `-Purge` takes the same path and dies at the same line.
//   3. The one failure mode that *is* expected -- scheduled tasks owned by
//      BUILTIN\Administrators after an elevated install -- was reported as a bare
//      "ERROR: Access is denied." line, because the diagnostic `throw` behind it was
//      unreachable (see the EAP assertions below), and its text taught the workaround as
//      if elevation were a requirement of uninstall rather than a consequence of how the
//      install ran.
//
// So this file pins three separable things: the probes stay non-fatal, uninstall keeps
// going when Node cannot be resolved at all, and the native-command diagnostic actually
// reaches the user. It sweeps whatever .ps1 the repo tracks rather than a fixed list, so
// the same file is meaningful in the open-source mirror (one installer) and downstream
// (three plus the service wrapper) without editing. The prose form of the native-stderr
// rule is pinned separately, by whichever repo's AGENTS.md carries that section.
